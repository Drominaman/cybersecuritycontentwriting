# Cybersecurity Content Writing

This repository now contains a lightweight static website built with plain HTML, CSS and a touch of vanilla JavaScript.

The page lists a few recommended cybersecurity content writers. Writer cards are generated dynamically in the browser and allow the user to toggle additional details for each writer.

## Usage

Open `index.html` in any modern web browser. No build step or server is required.

## Development

The dynamic behaviour lives in `script.js` and basic styles are in `style.css`. Feel free to expand the `writers` array or adjust the styles to fit your needs.
