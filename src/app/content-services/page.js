            <li>
              <b>How are cybersecurity content writers working in 2025?</b>
              <div>
                Companies producing large volumes of AI content are seeing mixed results. The best writing still happens when companies pair skilled writers with SMEs to produce engaging content.
              </div>
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>How much does a cybersecurity writer cost?</b>
              <div>
                Typically expect to pay between $70 and $150 per hour for a skilled writer with &gt;5 years of experience. 
              </div>
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>What kind of content can a cybersecurity content writer create?</b>
              <div>
                White-papers, blogs, case studies, infographics, solution briefs, reports, social posts, ads, thought-leadership articles, landing pages and more.
              </div>
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Will a cybersecurity content writer also do design for assets like white papers?</b>
              <div>
               Content Visit can also cover design and production as a full service agency.
              </div>
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Can I use AI instead of a cybersecurity content writer?</b>
              <div>
                Not really. AI can generate text but can’t write convincing cybersecurity content or copy. There’s no replacement for a market-oriented cybersecurity content writer at the moment.
              </div>
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Does a cybersecurity content writer need to be a practitioner?</b>
              <div>
                They need strong foundational technical knowledge but, more importantly, can interview true experts and help tell their stories.
